## Background

- Breathe-Easy was created for Hack NC State's double data track competition to give students an easy way to determine their area's air quality and pollutant levels. The app offers three main features - tracking of happiness, allergic reactions to pollen, and perception of air quality - and was built using Swift, URLSession, CoreLocation, and SwiftUI.


## Description

- Breathe-Easy is a powerful tool that utilizes multiple APIs to provide up-to-date information about air quality and pollutant levels. This information lets you quickly determine whether opening your windows and breathing is safe. Additionally, the app features a tracking function that helps you identify patterns or trends in your sensitivity to particular pollen or air pollutants. By correlating this data with your overall well-being, Breathe-Easy offers valuable insights into how air quality can impact your health.


## How to run

- To use Breathe-Easy, clone the GitHub repo onto your Apple computer and open the workspace in XCODE.
